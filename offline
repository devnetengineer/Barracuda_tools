On units that are smaller than Model 300 or any units that are heavily under load, it may be best to completely take the unit offline. If GUI is not accessible,
the best option is to disable Watchdog and kill the MTA agent and the spam inspection engine:


# touch /tmp/nowatchdog
# killall -9 bsmtpd
# killall -9 amavisd

This will ensure Watchdog service does not try to restart stopped services (every 5 minutes) and the appliance will stop accepting SMTP connections.
