For units experiencing serious load issues or mail is not being filtered due to corrupted spam/virus definition, you may often run into units with high number of 
messages in the Inbound queue. This is because the appliance is continuing to accept the SMTP connection and is queueing up the emails to be filtered but the appliance is
not actually able to filter the mail.

Moving the emails from Inbound queue to Outbound queue
*This is not recommended for the most part, but can be done at the customer's request since this bypasses spam filtering altogether and queues up the mail in the Outbound
queue for the MTA agent to deliver the message to the mail server



find /mail/email/ -size +10000k -type f -exec mv {} /mail/email_outbound/maildrop/ \; -print



*The "-size" parameter can be modified either higher or lower to accomodate the customer's request. All emails over 10MB will inherently take longer to process.
