If the customer is experiencing the following symptoms:

-certain user level settings are not being honored
-end-users are seeing old quarantine messages, that date way past the globally set configured retention policy

This may be due to the unit being out of spec and certain configurations are starting to break due to conflicting policies.

1. Check for the number of users

1123300@100.69.8.110 ~ # mysql
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 235406 to server version: 5.0.21
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> use config;
Database changed
mysql> select count(distinct scope_data) from config where scope = 'user';
+----------------------------+
| count(distinct scope_data) |
+----------------------------+
|                     102286 | 
+----------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
mysql>

This is critical because each Model software are spec-ced to filter a range of users. Because the appliances are not 
intended to be used as archiving service, the OS will automatically regulate the disk size to hit below 75% if it goes over.
Having too many users may fill up the disk space too fast, which may result in corruption that will cause the old messages
not to be deleted from the Quarantine inboxes and the old settings are used, despite the newly configured policy.

You can check the version using the following command:

1123300@100.69.8.110 ~ # version.pl | grep -i model
model: AWSX00

2. You can delete the old quarantine messages by exporting the userlist from Mysql to a TXT file, then running a for-loop 
bash script to locate the user's quarantine inbox and delete messages that are old.

1123300@100.69.8.110 ~ # # mysql -e "select distinct scope_data from config.config where scope ='user'" > /tmp/example10.txt

 for user in `cat example10.txt` ; do find /mail/message_log/messages/$user/q/* -mtime +30 -exec ls -l {} \; ; done
 -This is to check the absolute paths specified in the command are valid
 
 for user in `cat example10.txt` ; do find /mail/message_log/messages/$user/q/* -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} \; ; done
 -This is to actually remove the old message (as indicated by the "-exec rm -rf")
 
 **This for-loop will iterate as many times necessary and depending on the number of users, it may take a few hours
