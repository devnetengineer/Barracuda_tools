For mail delivery, often SSL/TLS protocol is used for secure transmission. Any issues you may encounter could be that the
server itself does not support STARTTLS, a valid certificate is not configured, or the certificate is mis-configured.

You can check to see if the server supports STARTTLS by doing a telnet connection and sending a EHLO:

1123300@100.69.8.110 ~ # telnet d205928b.ess.barracudanetworks.com 25
Trying 209.222.82.253...

Openssl can be used to check for the certificate of the server on the specified port, and openssl can also be used to send an email on the CLI, over SSL/TLS. 

1123300@100.69.8.110 ~ # openssl s_client -connect localhost:25 -starttls smtp -crlf -showcerts
CONNECTED(00000003)

Openssl can be used to specify a certain TLS version to test or even to send an actual email, using SSL/TLS:
